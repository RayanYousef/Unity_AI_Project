<br/>

This project is a Unity-based game that showcases my learning journey in AI using Finite State Machines and Nav Mesh Agents. The game features an enemy NPC that can chase the player using pathfinding, and the enemy NPC's behavior is controlled using a Finite State Machine.

**Features:**

-   Implementation of AI using Finite State Machines and Nav Mesh Agents.
-   Enemy NPC that can chase the player using pathfinding and attacks the player when in range.
-   The enemy NPC's behavior is controlled using a Finite State Machine.
-   Time scale for the game speed.
